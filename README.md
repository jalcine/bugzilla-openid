# bugzilla-openid

===

Provides OpenID support for Bugzilla

***

## Required Modules

bugzilla-openid needs Net::OpenID::Consumer in order to consume
those tasty OpenID urls.

## About

This plug-in was a dire request from the team behind the Synthetic Intellect
Institute to provide a solid and unified means of logging into Bugzilla without
having to use its cryptic system of logging in and registering.

## Features

Bugzilla-OpenID allows the following:

 - Users can:
   - register with a valid OpenID Url.
   - login with said OpenID Url.
   - link accounts to OpenID Url.

 - Administration can:
   - require all users to attach a OpenID Url to accounts.
